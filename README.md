# Finite-Cell-Method-1D
A basic implementation of Finite Cell Method for 1-D problems

For the more proper and detailed implementation, especially for the application of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional problems, 
please refer to the FCMLAB code which is implemented in TUM as cited in the references [2]. You can get access to FCMLab from [1]. Thank you for their wonderful work, as an curious person I try to get the concept of Finite Cell Method (FCM), and with this valuable implementation, I tried to implement my own version for the problem case of Uni-Axial Rod Example from [3]. The implemetation and detail of the structure of the FCMLab is described in [2]. In the following figures, the solution of axial strain values over the whole rod, and from the code that I implemented is illustrated to show the validation of my code. If you have additional questions, please feel free to contact with me.
