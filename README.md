# Finite-Cell-Method-1D
A basic implementation of Finite Cell Method for 1-D problems

For the more proper and the most proper implementation and for the application of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional problems, 
please refer to the FCMLAB code which is implemented in TUM, avaliable in [1]. Thank you for their wonderful work, and I get reference for my work. The implemetation and detail of the structure of the FCMLab
is described in [2].
